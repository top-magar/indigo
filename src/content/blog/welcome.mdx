# Welcome to Our Platform

We're excited to introduce our new multi-tenant e-commerce platform! This post will give you an overview of what we've built and how you can get started.

## What is Multi-Tenant E-commerce?

Multi-tenant architecture allows multiple businesses (tenants) to share a single application instance while keeping their data completely isolated. This means:

- **Cost Efficiency**: Shared infrastructure reduces costs for everyone
- **Automatic Updates**: All tenants benefit from platform improvements
- **Scalability**: The platform grows with your business

## Key Features

### Visual Store Editor

Our drag-and-drop store editor makes it easy to customize your storefront without any coding knowledge. You can:

- Add and arrange content blocks
- Customize colors and typography
- Preview changes in real-time
- Publish when you're ready

### Built-in Analytics

Track your store's performance with our comprehensive analytics dashboard:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Revenue | Total sales over time |
| Orders | Order volume and trends |
| Visitors | Traffic to your store |
| Conversion | Visitor to customer rate |

### Secure Payments

We've integrated with Stripe Connect for secure, reliable payment processing. Your customers can pay with:

- Credit and debit cards
- Apple Pay and Google Pay
- Buy now, pay later options
