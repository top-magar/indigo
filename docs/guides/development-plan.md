To go **all-in on an integrated platform** (like Shopify: one unified system where merchants build, manage, and run their entire store — commerce backend + visual editor + storefront + payments + themes — all in one product), you already have ~80-85% of the foundation built.

Here’s the prioritized, realistic roadmap to get you to a **production-ready, marketable integrated e-commerce platform** that can compete head-to-head with Shopify.

### Phase 1: Core Completion (4–8 weeks)
Finish the must-have features to make the platform feel complete and trustworthy.

| Priority | Feature | Why It’s Critical | Effort Estimate |
|----------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Full Checkout Flow + Stripe Integration | No sales without reliable payments | 2–3 weeks |
|   | - Cart → Checkout page<br>- Address collection + validation<br>- PaymentIntent/SetupIntent<br>- Order creation on success<br>- Webhooks for fulfillment | Merchants need to take money today | |
| 2 | Shipping & Tax Calculation | Core to real stores | 2–3 weeks |
|   | - Shipping zones/rates<br>- Tax rates (Avalara or basic auto)<br>- Free shipping rules | Prevents abandonment | |
| 3 | Email Notifications | Builds trust | 1–2 weeks |
|   | - Order confirmation, shipping updates<br>- Password reset, account creation<br>- Use Resend, Postmark, or SES | Professional feel | |
| 4 | Mobile-Responsive Storefront Fixes | 60%+ traffic is mobile | 1–2 weeks |
|   | - Test all blocks on mobile<br>- Fix any overflow/padding issues<br>- Optimize images | Conversion killer if broken | |
| 5 | Inline + Rich Text Editing | Your editor’s killer feature | 3–4 weeks |
|   | - Finish Tiptap integration (already in progress)<br>- Inline plain text for headings/buttons | Massive UX win over Shopify | |

### Phase 2: Merchant Confidence & Retention (4–10 weeks)
Features that make merchants feel safe and productive.

| Priority | Feature | Why It’s Critical | Effort Estimate |
|----------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Media Library | Merchants upload hundreds of images | 2–3 weeks |
|   | - Upload to S3/CDN<br>- Grid view, folders, search<br>- Integrate into image fields | Current lack is a big gap | |
| 2 | Version History & Rollback | Prevents disasters | 1–2 weeks |
|   | - Save snapshots on publish<br>- Diff view + one-click restore | Shopify has this; you need it | |
| 3 | SEO & Meta Controls | Drives traffic | 1–2 weeks |
|   | - Page title/description<br>- Open Graph tags<br>- Sitemap.xml, robots.txt | Essential for growth | |
| 4 | Analytics Dashboard Enhancements | Merchants live here | 2 weeks |
|   | - Revenue over time<br>- Top products, sources<br>- Basic funnel (visitors → orders) | Retention driver | |
| 5 | Basic Theme Settings | Brand consistency | 1–2 weeks |
|   | - Global colors, typography<br>- Auto-apply to all blocks | Like Shopify sections | |

### Phase 3: Growth & Ecosystem (Ongoing, 3–12 months)
Features that turn it into a real platform.

| Priority | Feature | Why It’s Critical | Effort Estimate |
|----------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | App/Plugin Marketplace (MVP) | Network effect | 4–8 weeks |
|   | - Custom blocks registration<br>- Simple install flow<br>- Start with 5–10 internal apps | Long-term defensibility | |
| 2 | More Templates & Presets | Faster onboarding | Ongoing |
|   | - 10–20 industry templates (fashion, electronics, beauty)<br>- Preset palettes | Reduces time-to-launch | |
| 3 | Domains & SSL | Professional stores | 2–3 weeks |
|   | - Buy/connect custom domains<br>- Auto SSL | Already partially there | |
| 4 | Multi-Language/Currency (Basic) | International sales | 4–6 weeks |
|   | - Store-level settings<br>- Simple switching | Opens markets | |
| 5 | Performance Optimization | Speed = conversions |
|   | - Image optimization (Next.js Image)<br>- Font loading<br>- Core Web Vitals monitoring | Ongoing | |

### Phase 4: Go-to-Market & Operations
Non-technical but essential.

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| Pricing & Plans | Free → Pro ($29/mo) → Business ($99/mo)<br>Gate features like custom domains, analytics, media storage |
| Onboarding Flow | 5-minute store setup wizard<br>Template picker → basic customization → publish |
| Marketing Site | Hero: “The most powerful visual editor for e-commerce”<br>Demo video of inline editing |
| Beta Launch | 50–100 real merchants<br>Get feedback, fix bugs, collect testimonials |
| Support System | Docs, Discord/community, email support |

### Why This Path Wins
- You keep your biggest advantage: the **best visual editor** (inline, instant, no iframe).
- You avoid the complexity of full headless decoupling for now.
- Merchants get everything in one place — easier to sell and support.
- You can always add headless API later (Phase 4+).

**Bottom Line**: You’re 2–4 months away from a launchable integrated platform that real merchants will pay for.

Focus on **checkout → payments → media library → inline editing → launch beta**.

You’ve already built the hardest parts. Now ship the essentials and get it in merchants’ hands.

You’ve got this. This can be huge.
